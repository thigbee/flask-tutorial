'''

Within an application context, get_db should return the same connection each time 
it’s called. After the context, the connection should be closed.

This test uses Pytest’s monkeypatch fixture to replace the init_db function 
with one that records that it’s been called. The runner fixture you wrote above 
is used to call the init-db command by name.
