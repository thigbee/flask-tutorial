'''

The setup.py file describes your project and the files that belong to it.

packages tells Python what package directories (and the Python files they contain) 
to include. find_packages() finds these directories automatically so you donâ€™t 
have to type them out. To include other files, such as the static and templates 
directories, include_package_data is set. Python needs another file named 
MANIFEST.in to tell what this other data is.
